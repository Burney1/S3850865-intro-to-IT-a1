    <p>
      The position I’ve selected from Seek.com is a high responsibility and senior role in businesses that requires people management and expert knowledge in IT. As Head of IT, the role would require me to meet KPIs for employee productivity and also system efficiency. Moreso, the role would involve seeing higher up visions and their executions in IT form. For example, a business need could be lowering costs, and thus making more efficient software will lower power draw. Being the bridge between the business’ needs and the way to achieve these things is what determines the worthiness of the role. Another alluring factor of the role is the excellent remuneration, something that shouldn't be expected at entry level experience obviously, but one can dream. The common saying that working a job that you love isn’t working a day in your life isn’t realistic, but I hope that I can find a role where I can balance both financial incentive and also enjoyment to stay sane. I think a role like this would balance my interest in seeing a user experience properly designed as well as my skills in managing people.
<br><br>
The skills, qualifications and experience required for the position are largely IT expertise and management skills. IT skills would likely be less dependent on programming as most of the programming is done by employees below this role. However, being able to read code is always important and as such it would be wise to have experience with Java, C and C++, Python, JavaScript and web markups. These languages are reported by Github and Stack OverFlow as the most mentioned languages. Thus, being able to read and evaluate the quality of code will be important in hiring and maintaining employees. Having qualifications from tertiary education will be essential to attaining this role, since competition is high in the job market and a bachelor degree is a bare minimum. Having completed further studies will also be helpful for success in the role. Experience in managing employees is also essential, as said before, the role requires bridging C-Level agendas to employees’ work. Communicating these agendas and strategies as well as maintaining good relationships with my potential boss is essential to remain employed.
<br><br>
Although I don’t currently have the skills or experience required for a senior position like this, I am in the process of obtaining them. However, it will take years and require many jobs at different organisations first, so it's not guaranteed I'll stick with this direction. Some things I am doing are guaranteed, such as completing this bachelor of information technology, something I decided to swap to after trying a different degree. I’ve also involved myself in programming experiences such as the Programming for Girls Tutoring program where I taught young girls how to program in Python. I also plan to do some extra credits in management and business from the previous course I was studying to boost my knowledge. This plan should be general enough that it doesn't force me into one very specialised part of the industry that way I can try different paths and figure my way out.
