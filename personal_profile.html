  <i>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i><br>
  The results of these tests I found very interesting because whilst I don’t see them as incorrect I also don't feel like they are a valid representation of my personality. Both the Myers-Biggs test and the Big Five Personality test concluded that I am an extrovert. I believe I am extroverted in situations where I am comfortable or surrounded by complete strangers, however in situations where I am surrounded by people I don't know but might see again I can come extremely introverted. The results from the Big Five Personality Test concluded that I was 76% agreeable which I do not agree with. However this might just be reserved for my friends, family and apple customer service because their reasons just don't make sense.

  <i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i><br>
  I think my personality within the group will be quite introverted as they fit into the description of people I don’t know but might see again. The 76% agreeableness I do think is relevant to how I will behave in a group because with a group of people that I am not comfortable with I am less likely to assert my opinion if it differs from the rest of the group. The Myers-Briggs test said I am 60% observant and I think this will be present within my ability to observe group members and their ideas. By hopefully recognising other’s ideas, I can help collaboration and creativity. I think I will work well within the group if we have a clear understanding and a visual representation of what needs to be completed.
  <br><br>
  <i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i><br>
  When forming a team I would be best suited in a group with at least one person I am friends with however I am from Sydney so I know absolutely no-one in Melbourne. I could combat this by trying to grow my comfort levels with the members of my group.  That would also help me be less agreeable with people when I disagree with what they are proposing. I take in a lot by observing what individuals do within a group which can be beneficial however only if I am able to vocalise my thoughts to help manage the team. I could ensure that there is visual representation for the tasks that the group needs to complete that way everyone has equal contribution.
