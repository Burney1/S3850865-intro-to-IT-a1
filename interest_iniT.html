    <i>What is your interest in IT? </i><br>
    <p2>My interest in IT is largely about User Experience Design UI design. I like this area of IT because it largely incorporates my interest in visual design, architecture and clean, modern aesthetics. A well designed User Experience makes a system seem like an extension of regular life, rather than a jarring computer program. </p2>
  <br><br>  <i>When did your interest in IT start?</i> <br>
  My interest or more so understanding of IT started when I was around 6. My childhood dog's name was Applet and growing up adults seemed to find it funny to ask me if I knew what applet meant so I leant that it was a Java program so I had a response for those who asked. After that I always had an interest in what made programs run and found it interesting to learn about how IT impacts the world around us. IT’s integration in society is another reason for my interest and from a young age my Dad would explain to me systems when we were at different places like hospital networking.


  <br><br>  <i>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</i> <br>
  My Interest in IT started when I was selecting subjects for my HSC. I was overseas at the time and my mum enrolled me in the IT course because she liked the subject. I was going to drop the subject but had to keep it due to the number of required courses, so I planned on dropping it at the end of the first year. I found that the subject was really interesting when I paid attention and there was still room to be creative within the subject. My limited experience within IT is being a tutor for Girls Programming Network which teaches young girls how to program.

  <br><br>  <i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i> <br>
  Choosing to study at RMIT was a difficult decision for me to make because it required me to move away from my family, friends and most importantly my darling Puppies. Having grown up in Sydney, I was not aware of many universities in Melbourne. However, I had heard about RMIT before and that it was said to be a good school for learning design and technology in workforce relevant matters, this is why I applied to RMIT University. I didn’t intend to move to Melbourne for University, but when I got accepted to RMIT I decided to uproot so that I could have a chance to live away from my family, meet new friends and explore a new city. In the long term, I hope my time at RMIT will help me develop skills in IT and its application in business so I can get a job.
